Title:  HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refractor

This project is designed to use HTML, CSS and Git to refractor code into a streamlined, working webpage. I built this project in order to incorporate the skills that I have learned so far, to showcase how HTML, CSS and Git all tie together.

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards to all viewers of the page as well as making our site optimized for those who search on the web.
